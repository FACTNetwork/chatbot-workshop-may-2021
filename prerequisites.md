# Prerequisites

## Download Required Software

You will need a code editor and modern browser.  If you don't have these, you can download and install them using the following links:

* Editor: Microsoft VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* Browser, choose one of the following:
    * Google Chrome [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
    * Mozilla Firefox [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    * (Mac users using Safari is OK too)
    * (Windows users using MS Edge is OK too)

## Download and Install Python 3

You will need to have Python 3 installed on your laptop in order to participate in these workshops.  Check if you have this installed already by opening up your terminal or command line and typing:

`python3 --version`

This should return something like the following if Python 3 is installed (your specific version number may vary and this is OK):

`Python 3.6.5`

Then type:

`pip3 --version`

This should return something like the following (again don't worry about specific version number):

`pip 9.0.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)`

If these commands don't work, then you can download Python 3 from the following link:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Try running:

`python3 --version`

and

`pip3 --version`

again after downloading and installing Python to make sure that your installation was successful.
